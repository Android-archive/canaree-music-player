## TODO
- try app on all API level
- test on foldable

- revamp blacklist fragment, with a tree based architecture
- think about posting on FDroid 

## TODO for methoud count reducing
- reduce method count (opening dex file take a lot of time on on app startup)
- remove last fm binding ~700 methods

### strange bug 
- audio is not paused on some devices during a call (Huawei P30 lite)

### bug-
- merged images don't update after content change (folders and genres)
- in ImageRetrieverRepository, when retrieving album image, if has same name as folder, extract the real 
    album with jaudio tagger instead of skipping download
      


## Maybe
- settings to blur lockscreen image
- try double tap to forward/replay?
- whitelist
- made sleep timer top and bottom curved
- fade on resume/pause
- Check for high res audio, see power amp
